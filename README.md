It's a Hostel Management Android Application which aims to reduce the overhead burden of hostel management on the side of college
administration and on the side of college students too.It was a part of TCS Remote Internship Project.In this app,the students are
given the facility to create their personal accounts,they can contact the emergency numbers from within the app directly
(depending on their hostels),they can book their rooms in hostels for upcoming year depending on their preferences and an option is
also provided to search for the blood donors of a particular blood group in case of an emergency.The blood donors can be directly
called or mailed from within the app.The benefit of this app is that the students can manage everything related to their hostel life
once they install it in their phones.
